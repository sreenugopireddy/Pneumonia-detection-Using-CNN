A normal chest X-ray shows clear lung fields with no abnormal white opacities or consolidations.

Radiographic characteristics of a normal chest X-ray include:

- Dark lung regions due to air presence
- No focal white patches
- No lobar consolidation
- Sharp and well-defined diaphragm borders
- Normal heart size and silhouette
- No diffuse interstitial infiltrates

When lungs appear uniformly dark without patchy bright regions, pneumonia is unlikely.

Normal scans indicate absence of fluid-filled alveolar regions.
