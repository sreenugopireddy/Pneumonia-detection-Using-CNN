Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. 
In chest X-rays, pneumonia often appears as areas of increased opacity 
or white patches indicating fluid or consolidation.

Common radiographic signs include:
- Lobar consolidation
- Patchy infiltrates
- Interstitial markings
- Air bronchograms

Bacterial pneumonia often shows focal consolidation.
Viral pneumonia often shows diffuse interstitial patterns.

Clinical symptoms include cough, fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing.
Early detection using chest radiographs is important for treatment planning.
